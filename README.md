# EventStore.js

Eventsourcing done in JavaScript. We will see, how far we can get with this and what it is really good for.

BEWARE: This is pretty much work in progress and evaluation.

## Installation

If using the PostgreSQL adapter, create a database and run the contents of `db-migration/postgres.sql` in a psql console. It will create the needed database structure for you.

The Memory Store is useful for testing.
